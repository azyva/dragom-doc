Dragom is an enterprise tool development framework for managing multi-module
reference graphs.

It makes working with such reference graphs as easy as working with single
modules.

Dragom also includes tools developed with this framework which operate on
multiple modules of a multi-module reference graph at once:

- Checkout
- Build
- Release
- Merge in main branch (reintegration merge)
- Merge arbitrary reference graphs
- Create a branch (development, release, etc.)
- Report
- Interact with build automation tools such as Jenkins

Dragom is developed in Java and mostly targets Java development which uses an
artifact-based development process and build tool such as Maven.

Dragom is FOSS (free and open-source software) licensed under the AGPL.

## Ask yourself these questions...

- Are you working on a Java system composed of a large number of independently
  released modules?
- Are you working on multiple such systems which share various versions of
  common reusable module?
- Is your development community composed of many developers or development
  teams working on the same systems simultaneously?
- Does your development landscape involve multiple simultaneous projects
  related to the same systems?
- Does releasing the multiple modules of your systems involve significant
  efforts?

Sorry for the clich√©, but if you answered yes to any of these, please read on.
Dragom may be the missing link your were looking for in your artifact-based
development process!
