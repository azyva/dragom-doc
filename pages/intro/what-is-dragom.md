Dragom is a plugin-based, extensible and highly configurable tool development
framework and tool set for managing multi-module reference graphs encountered
in artifact-based development.

It makes working with such reference graphs as easy as working with single
modules.

Dragom also includes tools which operate on multiple modules of a multi-module
reference graph at once:

- Checkout
- Build
- Create branches (development, release, etc.)
- Release
- Merge in main branch (reintegration merge)
- Merge arbitrary reference graphs
- Report
- Interact with build automation tools such as Jenkins

Dragom is developed in Java and mostly targets Java artifact-based development
processes and build tool such as Maven.

Being plugin-based and extensible, Dragom aims to integrate seamlessly with
other custom tools. But its stand-alone tools can also be used as is, or be
integrated through plugins with other existing tools.

Dragom currently integrates through plugins with the following external tools:

- Git
- Maven
- Jenkins

It also supports various strategies for creating branches and releasing
modules, including strategies compatible with continuous integration,
continuous delivery, semantic versioning, uniform date-based versioning and
others, all in the context of multi-module reference graphs.

Other plugins can and will be developed to support other tools and strategies.

Dragom is FOSS (free and open-source software) licensed under AGPL v3.

## Ask yourself these questions...

- Are you working on a Java system composed of a large number of independently
  released modules?
- Are you working on multiple such systems which share various versions of
  common reusable module?
- Is your development community composed of many developers or development
  teams working on the same systems simultaneously?
- Does your development landscape involve multiple simultaneous projects
  related to the same systems?
- Does releasing the multiple modules of your systems involve significant
  efforts?

Sorry for the clich√©, but if you answered yes to any of these, please read on.
Dragom may be the missing link you were looking for in your artifact-based
development process!
