<!--
Artifact-based development has become a very widespread and useful way of developing software. But it has remained tedious to use on large multi-module reference graphs, often requiring custom developement.

No tool exist on the market.

There are some tools which skim the surface (Maven dependency plugin), but do not offer a complete solution.
