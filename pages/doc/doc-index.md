Details

Dragom is [different things](what-is-dragom.html) to different people with
different documentation needs.

Dragom is a highly configurable framework and tool set. Configurators need to
learn how to configure Dragom and build preconfigured distribution packages.
This is documented in the [configurataor documentation](doc-config-index.html).

Dragom provides a base tool set. End users need to learn how to use these
tools. This is documented in the [end user documentation](doc-user-index.html).

Dragom is a plugin-based extensible framework which can be extended. Developers
need to learn how Dragom is designed, how to develop new plugins, jobs and
tools, or extend it in other ways. This is documented in the
[developer documentation](doc-dev-index.html).
