Details

Dragom is [different things](what-is-dragom.html) to different people with
different documentation needs.

Dragom is a highly configurable framework and tool set. Configurators need to
learn how to configure Dragom and build customized preconfigured distribution
packages. This is documented in the
[configurataor documentation](doc-config-index.html).

Dragom provides a base tool set. End users need to learn how to use these
tools. This is documented in the [end user documentation](doc-user-index.html).

Dragom is a plugin-based extensible framework which can be extended. Developers
need to learn how Dragom is designed, how to develop new plugins, jobs and
tools, or extend it in other ways. This is documented in the
[developer documentation](doc-dev-index.html).

{% include note.html content="<br/>Dragom introduces many specific concepts such as &quot;version&quot; and &quot;node path&quot;. Although it is generally clear when we speak about a Dragom concept, they are consistently written using PascalCase notation so that there is no confusion between the Dragom concept and the regular meaning of the word, and so that the words in a compound noun remain together and be easier to search for in documentation and code (where Dragom concepts are represented by Java classes). For example: &quot;Version&quot; and &quot;NodePath&quot;.<br/><br/>We go even further by pluralising them by consistently appending &quot;'s&quot; instead of simply &quot;s&quot; to emphasize the concept and avoid confusion, as in &quot;Version's&quot; and &quot;NodePath's&quot;." %}
