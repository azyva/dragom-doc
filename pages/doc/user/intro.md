{% include note.html content="<br/>Dragom introduces many specific concepts such as &quot;version&quot; and &quot;node path&quot;. Although it is generally clear when we speak about a Dragom concept, they are consistently written using PascalCase notation so that there is no confusion between the Dragom concept and the regular meaning of the word, and so that the words in a compound noun remain together and be easier to search for in documentation and code (where Dragom concepts are represented by Java classes). For example: &quot;Version&quot; and &quot;NodePath&quot;.<br/><br/>We go even further by pluralising them by consistently appending &quot;'s&quot; instead of simply &quot;s&quot; to emphasize the concept and avoid confusion, as in &quot;Version's&quot; and &quot;NodePath's&quot;." %}

{% include warning.html content="Dragom is highly configurable. Tool behavior is highly dependent on the customized preconfigured distribution package and on the Model. The information provided in this section attempts to be as accurate as possible, but in some cases, it may not reflect the exact behavior of tools for a given distribution. See the Dragom configurator in your organization for details about how it is configured and how the various tools behave." %}
