{% include note.html content="<br/>Dragom introduces many specific concepts such as &quot;version&quot; and &quot;node path&quot;. Although it is generally clear when we speak about a Dragom concept, they are consistently written using PascalCase notation so that there is no confusion between the Dragom concept and the regular meaning of the word, and so that the words in a compound noun remain together and be easier to search for in documentation and code (where Dragom concepts are represented by Java classes). For example: &quot;Version&quot; and &quot;NodePath&quot;.<br/><br/>We go even further by pluralising them by consistently appending &quot;'s&quot; instead of simply &quot;s&quot; to emphasize the concept and avoid confusion, as in &quot;Version's&quot; and &quot;NodePath's&quot;." %}
