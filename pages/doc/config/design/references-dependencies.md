[//]: # (TODO: no internal dependencies; only between ModuleVersion's; internal references are implementation details (but must be within the same ModuleVersion); submodules can refer between them, but once get out to another ModuleVersion, cannot come back since no cycle.; no outside references; dependency management vs dependencies vs parent in maven)
