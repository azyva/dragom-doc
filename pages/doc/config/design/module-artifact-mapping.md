Dragom operates mostly at the source code level but specifically supports
Artifact-based developpement. In this context references between
[ModuleVersion's][doc-config-design-module-version] are actually expressed in
terms of Artifact coordinates.

Dragom often needs to map Artifact coordinates to Module's and ModuleVersion's
and vice-versa.
