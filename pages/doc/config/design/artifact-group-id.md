An ArtifactGroupId is simply the combination of two first Artifact coordinate
axes, namely the groupId and the artifactId.

These are the two axes which are at a higher level than the ArtifactVersion.

The Dragom mapping mechanism maps Module's to and from ArtifactGroupId's, and
Version's to and fromArtifactVersion's.
